    <div class="box">
        <p>Waste is unwanted or useless material or substance resulting from human activities, industry, or natural processes. Waste can be solid, luquid, or gas. Waste can have negative impacts on the environment or health if not properly managed. Proper waste management is crucial to reduce these negative impacts. Based on my observations, I will explain plastic spoon waste.</p>

        <p>Plastic spoon waste is spoons made of plastic that are no longer used ang become waste. Plastic spoon waste results from single use and can pollute the environment. Plastic spoons that become waste can negatively impact marine life and animals. Furthermore, plastic spoon waste comes in black, white, clear, and other colors.</p>

        <p>Plastic spoon waste can also be recycled into new products, such at toys or furniture. Furthemore, reducing the use of single use plastic spoons can help reduce the amount of plastic spoon waste. In this way, we can help keep the environment clean and healthy. Proper management of plastic spoon waste is crucial for a brighter future.</p>

        <p>Waste plastic spoons can be recycled, for example, and used as raw materials to make new products. Waste plastic spoons can be turned into toys, furniture, or building materials, such as toy cars and decorations.</p>
